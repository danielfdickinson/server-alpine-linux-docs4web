Daniel's documentation for using Alpine Linux for local servers on x86-64 and Raspberry Pi family.

--------

The first member of Daniel Dickinson's 'Docs4Web' collection of repositories.

Docs4Web is a collection of documents in plain Markdown format that is intended for inclusion both on [Daniel's technical and professional website](https://www.wildtechgarden.ca/) as well as in the project which it documents, if applicable. In this case the hope is these docs will become part of the [Alpine Linux Docs](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/) or [Alpine Linux Wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/) or some combination of those)
