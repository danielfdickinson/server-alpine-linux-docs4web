# Partitioning on the Linux command line

Easiest but requires adding a package on Alpine and others (some distros include parted by default, others do not).

## Using fdisk

Available on many distributions as part of the core install.

TBD

## Using sfdisk

Also requires adding a package, but can be automated more easily than parted or fdisk.
