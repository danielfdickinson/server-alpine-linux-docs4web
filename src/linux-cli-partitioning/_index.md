# Partitioning on the Linux command line

[Partitioning information in the official Alpine Linux User's Handbook](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Installing/manual.html#_partitioning_your_disk)

## Using parted

Easiest of the command line options, but requires adding a package on Alpine and others (some distros include parted by default, others do not).

TBD

## Using fdisk

Available on many distributions as part of the core install.

TBD

## Using sfdisk

Also requires adding a package, but can be automated more easily than parted or fdisk.

TBD
