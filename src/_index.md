# Alpine Linux as a server

Daniel's documentation for using Alpine Linux for local servers on x86-64 and Raspberry Pi family.

These documents use only the 'main' repository, except in one or more [optional HowTo guides](howtos/_index.md).

In addition, these documents try to keep things DRY (don't repeat yourself) in order to avoid out-of-sync information on the same topic.

## Installation & configuration notes

[Install as a server on a Raspberry Pi](install-on-raspberry-pi/_index.md) 

[Install and configure base server (x86-64, Pi, and x86)](server-install-config/_index.md)

[Do important post-install configuration](important-post-install-configuration/_index.md)

[Add recommended tweaks and configuration](recommended-tweaks-and-configs/_index.md)
