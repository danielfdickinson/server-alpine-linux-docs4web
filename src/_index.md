# Alpine Linux as a server

Daniel's documentation for using Alpine Linux for local servers on x86-64 and Raspberry Pi family.

These documents use only the 'main' repository, except in one or more [optional HowTo guides](howtos/_index.md).

In addition, these documents try to keep things DRY (don't repeat yourself) in order to avoid out-of-sync information on the same topic.
